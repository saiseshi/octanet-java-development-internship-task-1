Creating an ATM interface in Java involves designing a user-friendly application that simulates the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine.
To begin, you would define a class for the main ATM interface, incorporating graphical components such as buttons, text fields, and labels.
Utilizing Java's Swing library or JavaFX, you can design the graphical user interface (GUI) to display essential elements like account balance,
withdrawal and deposit options, and transaction history.
The program should include methods for handling user inputs, such as PIN entry and transaction amounts. 
Implementing security measures like PIN verification is crucial to mimic real-world ATM interactions. 
Behind the scenes, you would write the logic for processing transactions, updating account balances, and maintaining transaction records.
Incorporating exception handling is essential to address potential errors, ensuring the program operates smoothly.
Overall, the development of an ATM interface in Java involves a combination of GUI design, event handling, 
and robust transaction processing to create a functional and user-friendly simulation of an actual ATM system.
